<h1>The Best Movies. Raimis Edition</h1>
<h2>My top 5 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>The Godfather works like a masterfully conducted orchestra, whose immaculate symphony is a meticulously crafted and extraordinarily integral thread in the fabric of cinema history</p>
<h3>Goodfellas</h3>
<p>Goodfellas captures the pulse of gangster life, not just to understand what motivates these people and how they compartmentalize their choices, but to supply the audience with a shock treatment of aversion.</p>
<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
<p>Arguably Spielberg's most visceral and inspired work, Saving Private Ryan speaks to devout patriotism, sacrifice and unflappable camaraderie. Sadly, these might be ideals our currently politically-divided country might never see eye-to-eye on again.</p>
<h3>Back to the Future</h3>
<p>Strip away the sci-fi, and this trilogy is a tale as old as time. It's a classic hero's journey, the story of someone growing up and discovering where his power really lies.</p>
<h3>Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
<p>To get to the point immediately, Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the most deliriously funny, ingenious and stylish American adventure movies ever made.</p>
